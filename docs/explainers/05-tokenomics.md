# Understanding King Blockchain Tokenomics: The Economic Engine

Ever wondered how digital economies work? King Blockchain's tokenomics (token economics) is like a carefully designed financial system that powers the entire ecosystem. Let's break down how it works and why it matters.

## The Dual-Token System

Think of King Blockchain's economy like a country with both a national currency (KINGBLOCK) and local currencies (Creator Tokens):

### KINGBLOCK Token
- The "national currency" of the ecosystem
- Used for platform governance
- Powers the staking system
- Provides fee discounts
- Total supply: 1 billion tokens

### Creator Tokens
- Like "local currencies" for each creator
- Customizable for each community
- Represents direct creator support
- Provides community benefits
- Supply set by creators

## KINGBLOCK Token Distribution

The KINGBLOCK token is distributed to ensure long-term sustainability:

| Allocation | Percentage | Purpose | Vesting |
|------------|------------|----------|----------|
| Community Treasury | 30% | Platform growth | Governed by community |
| Public Sale | 25% | Initial distribution | 25% immediate, 75% over 6 months |
| Team | 15% | Development incentives | 2-year vesting |
| Development Fund | 10% | Technical development | Strategic releases |
| Ecosystem Growth | 10% | Partnerships & marketing | Based on milestones |
| Liquidity Provision | 10% | Market stability | Locked for 1 year |

## How Value Flows Through the System

Imagine a circular economy where value flows between different participants:

### Revenue Sharing
```
Creator Sales (100%)
├── Creator (95%)
├── Platform Fee (5%)
    ├── Insurance Fund (1%)
    ├── Development (2%)
    └── Staking Rewards (2%)
```

## Creator Token Economics

Each creator token functions like a mini-economy:

|---------------|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Basic | 1,000 KINGBLOCK | 5% | Basic voting |
| Enhanced | 5,000 KINGBLOCK | 8% | 1.5x voting power |

# King Blockchain for Creators: Your Path to True Digital Independence

As a creator, you know the frustrations of traditional platforms - high fees, delayed payments, and the constant risk of deplatforming. King Blockchain changes all that by giving you true ownership and control over your digital presence.

## The Creator's Challenge Today

Let's be honest about what creators face on traditional platforms:

| Platform | Their Cut | Payment Delay | Deplatforming Risk |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| YouTube | 45% | 30-60 days | High |
| Twitch | 50% | 15-45 days | High |
| Patreon | 5-12% | 7-14 days | Medium |
| OnlyFans | 20% | 7-21 days | High |
